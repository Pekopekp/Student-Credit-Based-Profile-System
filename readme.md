# Student Profile System

## Vision
![alt text](icon.jpg)<br/>

The `Student Profile System` is a decentralized platform designed to manage student profiles and academic resources efficiently on the Ethereum blockchain. Our goal is to create a transparent, immutable, and secure system where students can register, share resources, earn credits, and build a reputation based on their contributions to the academic community. The platform is designed to encourage collaboration and knowledge-sharing among students, while also providing a reward system that acknowledges valuable contributions.
